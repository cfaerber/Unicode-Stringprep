NAME

  Unicode::Stringprep - Preparation of Internationalized 
                        Strings (RFC 3454)

DESCRIPTION

  This module implements the stringprep framework for preparing
  Unicode text strings in order to increase the likelihood that
  string input and string comparison work in ways that make sense
  for typical users throughout the world.  The stringprep protocol
  is useful for protocol identifier values, company and personal
  names, internationalized domain names, and other text strings.

  The stringprep framework does not specify how protocols should
  prepare text strings. Protocols must create profiles of
  stringprep in order to fully specify the processing options.

INSTALLATION

  To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

DEPENDENCIES

  This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Unicode::Normalize (core module as of perl 5.8.x)

PERL VERSION

  You should use perl 5.8.x or higher.

  Well, these modules DO work with perl 5.6.x. However, YOU have
  to make sure that you only pass valid UTF-8 strings to this
  module or you will get unintended results. perl 5.8.x (or
  higher) takes care of this by maintaining a UTF-8 flag for
  strings.
